# SALES PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD

## Problem Statement

Despite having access to raw sales data from various sources, It's lacks a centralized, dynamic, and intuitive reports to effectively visualize and analyze sales performance metrics in real-time. 

Current reporting methods are fragmented, static, and require extensive manual effort to compile and interpret data, leading to delays in decision-making, missed opportunities for sales optimization, and a lack of actionable insights.

The objective of developing a Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI is to address these challenges by creating a centralized solution that integrates data from various sources, providing interactive dashboards for real-time visualization of key sales metrics, and enabling efficient data analysis and decision-making across the organization.

This dashboard helps to understand their customers and products sale better. It helps to know if their customers are satisfied with their services. Through different visuals, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv, folder and xlsx files.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in given all dimensions and fact tables some tables need some modification according to visualizations requirement.
- Step 5 : In customer table made some changes like merge prefix, first name and last name column in full name column also capitalized each word.
- Step 6 : Created calendar table according to requirement.
- Step 7 : In the Power BI Desktop, under model view create Galaxy Schema relationship to connect all tables.
- Step 8 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected. 
- Step 9 : Since the data contains various info about sales, customers,  product, etc.  Visual filters (Slicers) were added.

- Step 10 : I create three page report, on executive summary page three KPI visuals were added to the canvas, to representing Monthly Revenue, Monthly Return Quantity and Monthly Orders. Also three Card visual added to the canvas to representing Total Profit, Top profitable product and Most ordered product.

           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.

- Step 11 : A Bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the total profit by each sub-category product. And Tree map to representing the total orders by category.
- Step 12 : A Bubble chart was also imported to the report design area representing the yearly total revenue and profit by country.
- Step 13 : On product details page Gauge and Line chart were added to report to show 10% target to previous month revenue and weekly total profit to line chart.
- Step 14 : On customer page Waterfall chart is created while creating this visual, field named "Gender" was also added to the Legends bucket, thus number of customers are also segregated according the gender. 

- Step 15 :Card Visual was used to represent different info mentioned below,

  (1) Total Profit

  (2) Top Profitable Product
  
  (3) Most Ordered Product
  
  (4) Product Adjusted Price
  
  (5) Product Adjusted Revenue
  
  (6) Product Adjusted Profit

  (7) Customer Name
  
  (8) Total Orders By Customer
  
  (9) Revenue Generated By Customer
  
In our dataset, Some parameters were assigned value blank, representing those parameters are not applicable for some visuals.

All these values have been ignored while calculating for each of the parameters mentioned above.


- Step 16 : In the report view, under the Product details page one Card visual were added to the canvas, which can filtered by drill through was mentioned & product page shows details for same product.

- Step 17 : Calculated column was created in which customers were grouped into various Categories by annual income.

Creating following conditional column in power query;
       
        = Table.AddColumn(#"Inserted Year", "Income_Categories", each if [AnnualIncome] > 150000 then "Very High" else if [AnnualIncome] > 100000 then "High" else if [AnnualIncome] > 50000 then "Average" else "Low")
        
Snap of new calculated column ,

- Step 18 : New measures was created to find Monthly Revenue.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Total Revenue = SUMX(AW_Sales_Fact,AW_Sales_Fact[OrderQuantity] * RELATED(AW_Products_DIM[ProductPrice]))
        
        & Previous Month Revenue = CALCULATE([Total Revenue],DATEADD(AW_Calendar_DIM[Date],-1,MONTH))

        Monthly Revenue = [Total Revenue]-[Previous Month Revenue]
        
A KPI visual was used to represent monthly revenue.

 - Step 19 : New measure was created to find  % of return rate of products,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of return rate of products,
 
         Return Rate % = DIVIDE((SUM(AW_Returns_Fact[ReturnQuantity])),(SUM(AW_Sales_fact[OrderQuantity])))
 
 A Matrix Table visual was used to represent this perecntage.
 
 Snap of % of return rate by each product.

 - Step 20 : New measure was created to calculate total Profit. & A Card visual was used to represent total profit.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total profit,
 
         Total Profit = (SUMX(AW_Sales_Fact,AW_Sales_Fact[OrderQuantity] * RELATED(AW_Products_DIM[ProductPrice]))) - (SUMX(AW_Sales_Fact,AW_Sales_Fact[OrderQuantity] * RELATED(AW_Products_DIM[ProductCost])))
         Or
         Total Profit = [Total Revenue] - [Total Cost]
    
 A Card visual was used to represent this total profit.

- Step 21 : New Line Chart visual is used for weekly profit,
 Snap of Line Chart weekly profit.
